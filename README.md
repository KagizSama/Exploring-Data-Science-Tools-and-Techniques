# Exploring Data Science Tools and Techniques

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook is a final project submission for a Coursera course, demonstrating foundational data science concepts and skills. It includes a mix of Markdown cells listing data science languages, libraries, and tools, as well as code cells performing basic arithmetic operations and time conversions. The notebook is created using Watson Studio and shared publicly via GitHub.

## Project Structure
The notebook (`FinalProject.ipynb`) contains the following exercises:
1. **Title**: A Markdown cell with the project title.
2. **Introduction**: A brief overview of the notebook’s purpose.
3. **Data Science Languages**: A list of popular programming languages used in data science.
4. **Data Science Libraries**: Key libraries for data analysis, machine learning, and visualization.
5. **Data Science Tools**: A table of tools commonly used in data science workflows.
6. **Arithmetic Expressions**: An introduction to example calculations.
7. **Multiply and Add Numbers**: A Python code cell performing multiplication and addition.
8. **Minutes to Hours**: A Python code cell converting minutes to hours.
9. **Objectives**: A list of the notebook’s learning goals.
10. **Author**: The creator of the notebook.
11. **GitHub Sharing**: The notebook is uploaded here for public access.
12. **Screenshot**: A screenshot of the first page is included in the submission.

## Prerequisites
- **Watson Studio**: Used to create and run the notebook.
